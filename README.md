**Association Rules Analysis Report**

The provided figure from a data mining SAS Miner tool displays the results of an association rules analysis. This type of analysis is commonly used to find patterns, correlations, or causal structures among sets of items in transactional databases or other data repositories. The interface presents several distinct views to understand the extracted rules: a scatter plot, a matrix plot, a line plot, and a textual output section.

**Statistics Plot**

The upper left of the interface shows a scatter plot with 'Support%' on the y-axis and 'Confidence%' on the x-axis. The plot points represent individual association rules, with blue squares likely indicating higher lift values and red squares indicating lower lift values. The lift value measures how much more often the antecedent and consequent of a rule occur together than expected if they were statistically independent. Higher lift values suggest stronger associations.

**Rule Matrix**

The upper right displays a matrix plot labeled "Rule Matrix," with the "Left Hand of Rule" on the y-axis and the "Right Hand of Rule" on the x-axis. This matrix visually represents the antecedents (left-hand side) and consequents (right-hand side) of each rule. Each point in the matrix corresponds to a rule, with the red and blue dots possibly differentiating between different confidence levels, support, or other metrics.

**Statistics Line Plot**

Below the scatter plot is a line plot with the 'Rule Index' on the x-axis and two metrics plotted: one for 'Support%' (blue line) and one for 'Confidence%' (red line). This plot shows the variation of support and confidence across the rules indexed. Sharp fluctuations in the lines indicate significant variances in the support and confidence among the rules.

**Output Text Section**

The lower right portion of the interface is a textual output section providing a timestamp for when the analysis was run. It includes a summary of variable types in the dataset and a detailed "Diagnostic Report" that lists individual rules with their support, confidence, and lift metrics, alongside the itemsets involved in each rule.

**Conclusions**

The analysis has successfully identified numerous association rules within the dataset. The scatter plot suggests that while many rules have moderate to high support, their confidence levels vary. The matrix plot allows for the quick identification of which items are most frequently associated with others, offering a clear visualization of the data's structure.

Rules with higher lift values, as indicated by the blue squares in the scatter plot, are particularly noteworthy as they represent strong relationships that may be of interest for further investigation or actionable business insights.

The line plot indicates that while some rules have strong support and confidence, others are weaker, suggesting a wide range in the strength of associations within the dataset.

The textual report section provides the granular details necessary to interpret individual rules, which could be invaluable for decision-making processes such as cross-marketing, layout planning, or inventory management.

**Sequential Pattern Analysis Report**

The provided figure presents the results of a sequential pattern analysis, which is aimed at discovering frequent subsequences or patterns in a dataset of sequences. This type of analysis is crucial in domains where understanding the order of events is important, such as in market basket analysis, web path traversal analysis, or biological data analysis. Below is the detailed interpretation of the analysis results for inclusion in a formal report.

**Variable Summary**

The report begins with a variable summary that classifies variables by role and measurement level:

- ID and SEQUENCE variables are at the interval measurement level, suggesting they are numerical data where the interval between values is meaningful.
- The TARGET variable is nominal, indicating that it is a categorical variable without a natural order.

**Sequence Report**

The sequence report section lists the results of the sequence analysis, including the following columns:

- Chain Length: Indicates the number of items in the sequence chain.
- Transaction Count: The number of transactions that contain the sequence.
- Support (%): The percentage of total transactions in the dataset that contain the sequence.
- Confidence (%): The likelihood that the consequent part of the rule is found in transactions that contain the antecedent part.
- Pseudo Lift: A measure used to evaluate the interestingness of an association rule, which compares the rule's confidence with the expected confidence if the items were independent.
- Rule: The specific sequence pattern discovered.
- Chain Item 1, Chain Item 2, Chain Item 3: The individual items making up the sequence.
- Rule Index: An identifier for the specific rule.

The report shows that the rules vary in length and strength (as indicated by support and confidence). For example, the rule "P003 =\> P002" appears multiple times with varying support and confidence levels, suggesting it is a common sequence in the dataset. The pseudo lift values greater than 1.0 indicate sequences where the occurrence of the antecedent significantly influences the occurrence of the consequent.

**Rule Statistics**

The "Rule Statistics" section provides a summary of the measures obtained from the MEANS procedure in the analysis:

- The minimum, maximum, and mean chain length are provided, with a maximum length of 4, indicating that no sequence is longer than four items.
- The support metric ranges from approximately 11% to 44%, and the confidence ranges widely, with a mean of approximately 70%, suggesting varying degrees of rule reliability.

**Frequent Sequence Report**

The "FREQ Procedure" section at the bottom of the report summarizes the frequency of chain lengths:

- The majority (31 out of 32) of the sequences have a chain length of 2, signifying that most of the discovered sequences involve pairs of items.
- The cumulative percentage indicates the proportion of the sequences covered, with 100% of sequences having a chain length of 2 or 3.

**Conclusion**

The sequential pattern analysis has identified several significant item sequences within the dataset. These sequences vary in their prevalence and confidence levels, offering insights into the typical order of events or transactions. Rules with higher pseudo lift values and confidence levels are of particular interest as they may represent strong and potentially actionable patterns.

The predominance of chain lengths of 2 suggests that the dataset contains a substantial amount of pairwise item interactions. These findings can be utilized to improve decision-making in areas such as sales sequencing, product recommendation systems, and inventory management. Future analysis may focus on exploring the contexts of these sequences further to fully capitalize on the patterns unearthed by this analysis.

## DECISION TREE:

### DATA PARTITION:

![](RackMultipart20240215-1-5ddgrd_html_2eaefb2ee096c3f3.png)

**Data Partition Properties Analysis Report**

The provided figure showcases the data partition properties from a node within a data processing or machine learning workflow. These settings are crucial as they dictate how the data is divided for the purposes of model training, validation, and testing. Below is an interpretation of these properties as they would be presented in a formal report.

**General Properties**

- Node ID: Labeled as "Part," indicating the identifier or the name of the data partitioning process within the workflow.
- Imported Data: The ellipsis (...) suggests that there is more information or specific settings related to the data being imported, which are not visible in this view.
- Exported Data and Notes: These fields are present but do not display any content in the current view, indicating either default settings are being used or the information is not applicable to the current step.

**Variables Settings**

- Output Type: Set to "Data," which likely means the output of this partitioning process is a dataset ready for subsequent analysis or modeling.
- Partitioning Method: Specified as "Default," suggesting that the SAS Miner's default partitioning algorithm is used.
- Random Seed: The value "12345" is used to ensure reproducibility in the random partitioning process.

**Data Set Allocation**

- Training: Allocated 70.0% of the data, which will be used to train the model.
- Validation: Allocated 30.0% of the data, which is typically used to tune the model parameters and prevent overfitting.
- Test: Allocated 0.0% of the data, indicating that there is no separate test dataset defined in this process for final model evaluation.

**Report Settings**

- Interval Target: Set to "Yes," implying that the target variable for modeling is interval-scaled, meaning it is numerical with meaningful distances between values.
- Class Targets: Also set to "Yes," which may indicate that there is also a categorical target variable being considered.

**Conclusion**

The data partition properties outlined in this report suggest that the process is configured to divide the data into training and validation sets, with a significant majority allocated to training. The use of a random seed guarantees that the partitioning can be replicated, ensuring consistent results across different runs. The absence of a test set indicates that the model's performance may be assessed using other means, such as cross-validation within the training set. The settings also indicate that both interval and categorical targets are considered, which may imply that the subsequent modeling could involve prediction of numerical values or classification into categories. The successful and swift completion of the data partitioning process sets a solid foundation for model development and evaluation.

### Decision Tree (with Ordinal Target Cretiration as Entropy):

![](RackMultipart20240215-1-5ddgrd_html_a6f708d71c62aff6.png)

![](RackMultipart20240215-1-5ddgrd_html_578fb39a2b90e050.png)

![](RackMultipart20240215-1-5ddgrd_html_dab8a952c47e969b.png)

**Decision Tree Analysis Using Entropy**

This analysis aimed to understand the factors influencing customer product category preferences. We constructed a decision tree with the target variable being the ordinal classification of product categories purchased. The decision tree algorithm utilized entropy as the criterion for creating the splits. Entropy, a concept borrowed from information theory, measures the unpredictability in the dataset. When used in decision trees, it helps in selecting the attribute that brings the most information gain by reducing uncertainty.

The root node (Node Id: 1) represents the entire dataset before any splits have occurred. Here, the distribution across five different product categories (P001 to P005) is fairly even in the training set. The validation set percentages provide a measure of how well the model generalizes to unseen data, with a similar distribution observed.

From the root node, the dataset is split into two branches based on the category of products purchased—'ELECTRONICS, GROCERIES,...' (Node Id: 2) and 'BEAUTY' (Node Id: 3).

Node Id: 2 (ELECTRONICS, GROCERIES,...)
 This node represents customers with preferences in electronics, groceries, and other similar categories. We see a shift in the distribution of product categories compared to the root node, particularly in category P003, which has a lower representation here (3.57% in training and 14.29% in validation). This suggests that customers in this branch are less likely to prefer the product category P003.

Node Id: 3 (BEAUTY)
 This node encompasses customers whose preference is the beauty category. Notably, the distribution in this node is significantly different, with P003 being the predominant category (85.71% in training and 60.00% in validation), indicating a strong preference for this product category within this branch.

### Decision Tree (with Ordinal Target Cretiration as Gini):

![](RackMultipart20240215-1-5ddgrd_html_acc7bd4c62a7ffa6.png) ![](RackMultipart20240215-1-5ddgrd_html_691cf99621e28104.png)

![](RackMultipart20240215-1-5ddgrd_html_b20ff8dff81081d4.png)

**Decision Tree Analysis Using Gini Impurity**

Our analysis deployed a decision tree to dissect customer preferences across different product categories. The decision tree leverages the Gini impurity index as a splitting criterion, which measures the frequency at which any element of the dataset will be mislabeled if it was randomly labeled according to the distribution of labels in the dataset. The goal of the decision tree is to minimize Gini impurity; the best split is the one that decreases impurity the most.

At the root of the tree (Node Id: 1), the dataset encompasses all customers, with a distribution across five product categories (P001 to P005). The percentages shown reflect the proportion of each category within the training set and how well this distribution is mirrored in the validation set. The training set consists of 35 instances, while the validation set contains 19.

The decision tree has identified "Category" as a significant feature to split the data, resulting in two branches:

- The left branch (Node Id: 2) represents the "ELECTRONICS, GROCERIES,..." category. In this node, the distribution of product categories is slightly different from the root, with P002 and P005 having higher proportions in the validation set compared to the training set, which might suggest a validation set that is not perfectly representative of the training data, or it could indicate model overfitting.
- The right branch (Node Id: 3) is for the "BEAUTY" category. Here, we see a stark difference, with P003 becoming the dominant category in both the training (85.71%) and validation (60.00%) sets, indicating a strong preference for this category among customers in this branch.

The 'Count' represents the number of records in each node, with Node Id: 2 containing 28 training and 14 validation records, and Node Id: 3 containing fewer records—7 in training and 5 in validation.

### Model Comparison

![](RackMultipart20240215-1-5ddgrd_html_8f82144389fcecee.png)

**Score Rankings Overlay Graph:**

The first image shows a 'Cumulative Lift' graph for what appears to be two different decision tree models, indicated by 'Decision Tree' and 'Decision Tree (2)'. Cumulative lift is a measure used in predictive models to determine the effectiveness of the model at predicting a certain outcome compared to random chance. It's typically used in marketing to assess the impact of targeting strategies.

In the training set (upper graph), the cumulative lift starts high and remains constant for a while, which suggests that at the beginning of the scoring, the model is effectively identifying the positive cases. However, it sharply drops as 'Depth' increases, indicating that as you move deeper into the dataset (likely scoring more cases), the model becomes less effective compared to the baseline.

In the validation set (lower graph), the cumulative lift consistently increases, which indicates that the model is performing better as it scores more cases. This is a somewhat unusual pattern and might suggest that the model is, in some way, better at identifying cases that are less obvious or that there is some variation in the data that the model is picking up on.

Based on the analyses of the variables list, decision tree outputs, and model comparison charts, here are the key insights and strategic recommendations for the retail company:

## CONCLUSION

### Key Insights:

**1. Customer Segmentation:**

The decision tree models indicate distinct customer preferences for product categories. Understanding these preferences can segment customers effectively, which is essential for targeted marketing.

### Customer Segmentation through Decision Tree Analysis:

- **Behavioral Patterns:**

The decision trees have likely used purchase history and customer demographics to determine patterns. For instance, certain demographic groups may prefer electronics, while others lean towards beauty products. Identifying these patterns allows the company to segment customers not just by demographic variables like age or income, but by their behavior and preferences.

- **Targeted Marketing Campaigns:**

Once segments are identified, marketing campaigns can be designed to appeal specifically to the interests of those segments. For example, if one segment shows a strong preference for high-tech electronics, marketing emails to this group could feature the latest gadgets and tech reviews.

- **Customized Promotions:**

Promotional strategies can be tailored to the preferences of each segment. A segment that frequently purchases groceries might be targeted with weekly deals, loyalty discounts, or reminders of their usual purchases, while beauty enthusiasts might receive updates on the latest skincare trends and exclusive invitations to product launches.

### Strategic Recommendations:

**1. Refine Marketing Strategies:**

Utilize the insights from the customer segmentation to develop personalized marketing campaigns. For example, target customers who are identified as likely to purchase beauty products with relevant offers and promotions.

**2. Product Placement and Inventory:**

Adjust inventory levels based on the predictions of the decision tree models to ensure products in demand are readily available, especially in categories like electronics and beauty where clear preferences are identified.

**3. Cross-Selling Opportunities:**

Employ association rule mining to discover which products are often purchased together. Use this information for bundling products and offering discounts on complementary items to increase basket size.

**4. Prevent Overfitting:**

Investigate the decision tree model that showed a decline in performance on the training set as depth increased. Simplify the model if necessary to improve its generalizability, and ensure that it is trained on a representative sample of the customer base.

**5. Continuous Model Evaluation:**

Regularly review and update the decision tree models with new data to ensure that they adapt to changing customer behaviors and market trends.
